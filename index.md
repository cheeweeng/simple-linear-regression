# simple-linear-regression

This lab uses simple linear regression to explore the relationship between two continuous variables. 
The project will perform a complete simple linear regression analysis, which includes:  
1.  creating and fitting a model,
2.  checking model assumptions,
3.  analyzing model performance,
4.  interpreting model coefficients,
5.  communicating results to stakeholders.

This activity will develop your knowledge of linear regression and your skills evaluating regression results which will help prepare you for modeling to provide business recommendations in the future.
